Perl Bindings for Selenium 2.0 Remote Driver

This is a very early (read alpha) work of Perl Bindings for Selenium 
2.0 bindings. This binding will not work with the 1.0 version of 
Selenium. Please use WWW::Selenium from CPAN if you're interested in
1.0 bindings. 

The wire protocol has changed for Selenium remote server since alpha1 & 
this code is currently only going to work with alpha2 release of the server. 

Some of the code & most of the test suites are pretty much boiler 
plate, so if you really want to play with bleeding edge code, download 
the code & play with it.
