Perl Bindings for Selenium 2.0 Remote WebDriver

This is a Perl Binding for Selenium 2.0 Remote WebDriver, which you
should download from http://code.google.com/p/selenium; look for
selenium-server-standalone.jar.  This binding will not work with the
1.0 version of Selenium. Please use WWW::Selenium from CPAN if you're
interested in 1.0 bindings.

The unit tests provide various examples on how to invoke & use the module.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

UNIT TESTS

This module uses LWP::Protocol::PSGI to facilitate unit
tests. LWP::Protocol::PSGI overrides the LWP HTTP/HTTPS & this allows
us to "mock" the interaction with WebDriver Server. In regular instances
you should be running the tests against the mocked recording, which are
stored in t/mock-recordings. If you want to run the tests live against
the WebDriver server, set an environment variable WD_MOCKING_RECORD to
1. This will force the unit tests to run tests against the WebDriver
server & also save the traffic (request/response) in t/mock-recordings.
Either reset the environment variable or set it to 0 to revert to mocking
the traffic.
