=head1 DESCRIPTION

Selenium::Remote::Mock::RemoteConnection is a class to act as a short-circuit or a pass through to the connection to a Selenium Server.
Using this class in place of L<Selenium::Remote::RemoteConnection> allows one to:

=over

=item *
record interactions with the Selenium Server into a JSON file

=item *
replay recorded interactions from a JSON file to mock answers from the Selenium Server

=item *
mock responses to specific functions

=back

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 Record interactions

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Selenium::Remote::Driver;
    use Selenium::Remote::Mock::RemoteConnection;

    # create a new Mock object to record the interactions with Selenium
    # Server
    my $mock_connection = Selenium::Remote::Mock::RemoteConnection->new( record => 1 );

    # the Mock object is passed to the driver in place of what would be
    # a regular Selenium::Remote::RemoteConnection object
    my $driver = Selenium::Remote::Driver->new( remote_conn => $mock_connection );

    # always store the session id, as it will become undef once
    # $driver->quit is called
    my $session_id = $driver->session_id;

    # do all the selenium things and quit
    $driver->get('http://www.google.com');
    $driver->get('http://www.wikipedia.com');
    $driver->quit;

    # dump the session to a file
    $mock_connection->dump_session_store( 'my_record.json' );


This code, above doing some basic Selenium interactions, will end up generating a JSON file containing all the requests and their responses for your Selenium session.
The JSON file looks like this :

    '{
        "HTTP_REQUEST_URL {request_parameters}":[response1,response2,...],
        ...
    }'

The reason why we store array of responses is that the exact same request can be made more than once during a session, so we have to store every response to the same requests.

=head2 Replay interactions

    #!perl
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Test::More;
    use Test::Selenium::Remote::Driver;
    use Selenium::Remote::Mock::RemoteConnection;
    my $mock_connection_2 =
      Selenium::Remote::Mock::RemoteConnection->new( replay => 1,
        replay_file => 'my_record.json' );
    # javascript + version parameters added or else it will not work
    my $driver =
      Test::Selenium::Remote::Driver->new( remote_conn => $mock_connection_2, javascript => 1, version => '' );
    $driver->get_ok('http://www.google.com');
    $driver->get_ok('http://www.wikipedia.com');
    $driver->quit;
    done_testing;

Using the file generated with the recording snippet from the section before, we are able to mock the responses.

Note that there is one small limitation (that I hope to remove in future versions), is that a record generated with L<Selenium::Remote::Driver> is not directly useable with L<Test::Selenium::Remote::Driver>.
This is mainly because the way the two instances are created are a bit different, which leads to different requests made, for creating a session for instance.
For now, what works for sure is recording and replaying from the same class.

    use Test::More;
    use Test::Selenium::Remote::Driver;
    use Selenium::Remote::WebElement;
    use Selenium::Remote::Mock::Commands;
    use Selenium::Remote::Mock::RemoteConnection;

    my $spec = {
        findElement => sub {
            my (undef,$searched_item) = @_;
            return { status => 'OK', return => { ELEMENT => '123456' } }
              if ( $searched_item->{value} eq 'q' );
            return { status => 'NOK', return => 0, error => 'element not found' };
        },
        getPageSource => sub { return 'this output matches regex'},
    };
    my $mock_commands = Selenium::Remote::Mock::Commands->new;

    my $successful_driver =
      Test::Selenium::Remote::Driver->new(
        remote_conn => Selenium::Remote::Mock::RemoteConnection->new( spec => $spec, mock_cmds => $mock_commands ),
        commands => $mock_commands,
    );
    $successful_driver->find_element_ok('q','find_element_ok works');
    dies_ok { $successful_driver->find_element_ok('notq') } 'find_element_ok dies if element not found';
    $successful_driver->find_no_element_ok('notq','find_no_element_ok works');
    $successful_driver->content_like( qr/matches/, 'content_like works');
    $successful_driver->content_unlike( qr/nomatch/, 'content_unlike works');

    done_testing();

Mocking responses by hand requires a more advanced knowledge of the underlying implementation of L<Selenium::Remote::Driver>.
What we mock here is the processed response that will be returned by L<Selenium::Remote::RemoteConnection> to '_execute_command' call.
To accomplish this we need :

=over

=item *
a spec: a HASHREF which keys are the name of the methods we want to mock. Note that those keys should also be valid keys from the _cmds attribute in L<Selenium::Remote::Commands>.
The value of each key is a sub which will be given two parameters:

=over

=item *
$url_params : the values that should have been replaced in the URL
For instance, on the example above, it would have been:
    { session_id => 'some_session_id'}

=item *
$params : the original parameters of the request.
On the example above it would have been:
    { value => 'q', using => 'xpath'}


=back

The sub used as a value in the spec is not expected to return anything, so you have to craft very carefully what you return so that it will produce the expected result.

=item *
a mock_cmd: a L<Selenium::Remote::Mock::Commands> object. This is used mainly to hijack the normal commands so that placeholders do not get replaced in the URLs.

=head1 BUGS

This code is really early alpha, so its API might change. Use with caution !
