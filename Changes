0.1801 4-9-2014
        [DOCUMENTATION]

        [BUG FIXES]

        - #119 Restore broken find_elements functionality - should return an arrayref or an array

0.18   3-28-2014
        - New maintainer: Daniel Gempesaw <gempesaw@gmail.com>
        - Fix failing tests in CPAN distribution!

        [THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
        - We now 'croak' instead of returning error strings in a number of
          cases where invalid method calls were made. This should make
          debugging easier in some cases, and is more aligned with our
          documentation which already stated that we would croak on errors.
          Still, your code may depend on the old behavior.
          https://github.com/aivaturi/Selenium-Remote-Driver/commit/7cdf3dce0fcaa48a883d045368c094351754e85a

        - The hover() method on the WebElement has been removed. This is not in the JSON Wire protocol,
          and the same functionality is avialable with the Driver object's move_to() method.
          https://github.com/aivaturi/Selenium-Remote-Driver/pull/77

        [NEW FEATURES]
        - Merged Test::WebDriver into this distribution as Test::Selenium::Remote::Driver.
          Several updates to it are included since the last release. (Mark Stosberg)

        - The existence of most (or all?) key testing methods in
          Test::Selenium::Remote::Driver is now documented, rather than leaving it to users
          to figure out the magic effects of AUTOLOAD on the methods in the parent
          class. (Mark Stosberg)

        - Added type_ok() to Test::Selenium::Remote::Driver, similar to the method by the same name
          from Test::WWW::Mechanize (Mark Stosberg)

        - Added several methods to Test::Selenium::Remote::Driver that allow you to find
          an WebElement and test against in a single command. (Mark Stosberg)
          The test methods for WebElements include:

             type_element_ok   - find an element and type into it.
             element_text_is   - find an element and check the text.
             element_value_is  - find an element and check the value.
             click_element_ok  - find an element and click on it.
             clear_element_ok  - find an element and clear it.
             is_element_displayed_ok - find an element and check to see if it's displayed.
             is_element_enabled_ok - find an element and check to see if it's enabled.

        - Added and started using Test::Selenium::Remote::WebElement. This a
          sub-class of Selenium::Remote::WebElement. This allows testing
          methods on the "WebElement" object as well as main '$driver' object.

        - Added a pause() function, that sleeps for the given number of milliseconds, just like
          Test::WWW::Selenium.  https://github.com/aivaturi/Selenium-Remote-Driver/issues/60

        - new() now accepts a 'default_finder' option to allow you to change the default finder, which
          is currently 'xpath'. This will be of interest to those who prefer CSS-style selectors,
          such as jQuery uses.
           https://github.com/aivaturi/Selenium-Remote-Driver/pull/49

        - new() now accepts a 'webelement_class' option to allow you to specify an alternate WebElement class.
          This could be used to add testing methods or functionality for WebElements.

        - Shortcut methods absorbed from Test::WebDriver into Selenium::Remote::Driver:

          get_text() Returns the text for a particular element.
          get_body() Returns the text for the whole body.
          get_path() Returns the path part of the current URL.

        - New short method to save a screenshot to a file: $driver->capture_screenshot($filename).
          The name was chosen for compatibility with a WWW::Selenium method of the same name.

        - Removed 'get_location()' as an alias in Test::Selenium::Remote::Driver.
          Please use the more specific 'get_current_url()' instead.
          It's a more specific name that matches the Selenium API method name.

        - Adding text checking methods to Test::Selenium::Remote::Driver

            # Run regex's against the entire page source
            content_like()
            content_unlike()

            # Run regex's against just the "text" of the page
            body_text_like()
            body_text_unlike()

            # Check page source for strings
            content_contains()
            content_lacks()

            # Check text of page for strings
            body_text_contains()
            body_text_lacks()

          The names are intentionally the same as their Test::WWW::Mechanize
          counterparts.  However, these methods may take an arrayref of regular
          expressions for improved performance when you want to run multiple
          tests against the same page.

          Normally Selenium::Remote::Driver would make an HTTP request to the
          driven browser for each content check. By using an arrayref for
          multiple checks of the same page, you can avoid the extra HTTP
          requests and speed up your tests. (Mark Stosberg)


        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - Updated ChangeLog to reflect that debug_on() and debug_off() methods were added in 0.16.

        [INTERNALS]
        - Switch S::R::D to Moo; this should not have any adverse impacts, as our API is unchanged

        - Take advantage of additional Dist::Zilla plugins (travis, commitbuild, autoprereqs, etc)

        - MIME::Base64 is now only loaded if it used for a file upload or taking a screenshot.
          This will create a minor speed-up for common cases which don't use these features.

        - Explained why the code does 'use 5.006; use v5.10.0;', and it's not pretty.
           The short version: before perl 5.006, the v-string 'v5.10.0' would not be understood.
           The page http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/369/version-numbers-should-be-boring/
           explains it in much more detail than I can.
           Fortunately, it boils down to this: http://perldoc.perl.org/5.10.0/functions/use.html#use-VERSION

        - Added Test::LongString as a dependency to support the new content checking methods.

0.11   8-16-2011
  This is quite a large list for this release and will be
  the first cpan release. The later releases will hopefully
  happen often and won't be quite as large.

        - subroutine calls carp when an error occurs or when
          an element cannot be found
        - if an element cannot be found, carp should tell you
          which line in your local script where the element was
          not found
        - added the following driver api calls
           click,double_click,button_down,button_up,close,status,
           send_modifier,execute_script,execute_async_script

        - fixed the following api calls
           refresh,delete_cookie_named
        - $element->get_value is deprecated...
           subroutine now points to get_attribute('value')
        - added the following element api calls
           describe
        - added initial IDE plugin for the Selenium-IDE
           (this is based off the Rspec webdriver ide plugin)

        - Added "extra_capabilities" named argument to the driver
        - make send_keys accept one or more string argument
        - added javascript method to driver
           (thanks Phil Kania!)

        - fixed issue: check for empty string before trying to decode
        - fixed issue: if script using the module ever forked, the
          driver would call quit whenever that fork was closed
        - fixed issue: Marked as deprecated: WebElement::set_selected
          and WebElement::toggle
        - fixed issue: global $driver variable in WebElement caused the
          remote connection to be destroyed before the driver was able
          to call quit()

        - fixed issues:
          - improper definition of setImplicitWaitTimeout
          - Driver.pm: missing 'css' entry in FINDERS
          - Driver.pm::find_elements: set up $using correctly
            (thanks Phil Mitchell!)

0.10    5-2-2010
        - Implemented support for JSON wire protocol as of a4 release of
        Selenium 2.0.
        - The main Driver & WebElement modules are implemented & functional.

        supported as the server itself is alpha & mocking its behavior doesn't
        help our cause.
        - Added POD for Driver & WebElement
0.01    2-21-2010
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
